      <h2>A little bit about me: </h2>
      <p>My name is Drake Tyksinski, I was born and raised in Washington State. I'm 28 years old and currently looking to start a new career in software engineering and web development! I spent most of my adult life working restaurant jobs, I'm ready for bigger and better things. 
      <br /><br />
      I got sober a little over a year ago, and ever since then I have been working on improving myself mentally, physically and emotionally.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
      <p>I am very passionate about fitness and working out, the gym is like a second home to me. In 2019 I competed in a bodybuilding competition, and I would like to do another in the future. 
      <br /><br />
      I'm a huge nerd, I love playing video games and I spend a lot of my free time gaming with friends. I actually met my girlfriend on a video game, she lives in West Virginia and we have been doing long-distance since we met. 
      <br /><br />
      If I'm not gaming or working out, I like to spend time with my friends and family. I'm fortunate to have a very loving and supportive family, as well as a ton of amazing friends.
